- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m AgileBeaver (@agilebeaver-blog)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development concerning Java & Java EE, JavaScript frameworks like Angular, ReactJS, vue.js and alike. And the development should be done with some professionality, so I always consider doing continuous integration with as much automation as possible - no one wants to do some hard (or cerebral challanging or boring) task again and again ;)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin to gather experience in the language potentials and its pitfalls.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: follow me on my new blog https://blog.agilebeaver.com (the first topics will be ublished end of September 2024).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: calm and reflective
- âš¡ Fun fact: I do a lot of cycling on a racer, most of the time in noth-western Germany.
